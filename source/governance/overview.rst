Introduction
------------

OKChain adopts the concept of on-chain governance. OKChain uses the
``Proposal`` approach to achieve on-chain governance. We believe that
this can better reflect the decentralized concept of our system. Okt
holders can participate in the governance process of OKChain by
initiating proposals, depositing proposals and voting on proposals
(which involves okt).
