staking
=======

Staking is an important basic module supporting DEX’s PoS (Proof of
Stake) consensus mechanism. It determines the number of block producer
sets in each election period according to the total amount of delegated
proof of stake accepted by super nodes, and dynamically determines the
block order according to the voting power. Meanwhile, it also provides
necessary support for delegation relationships and information query of
super nodes to distribution and gov modules.

Through staking, you can freely create validators, update validators,
delegate proof of stake to trusted validators, cancel delegation from
validators that you no longer trust, and re-delegate proof of stake
currently delegated to a validator to other validators.

Rotation mechanism
------------------

OKChain will re-elect block generation nodes from each set at each fixed
block height interval which is called cycle. The block generation set is
fixed and the identities of block generation nodes in the set remain
unchanged during the same cycle. At the penultimate block height
interval during the same cycle, staking will rotate the block generation
node sets for the next cycle. The top 21 nodes with the highest number
of okt will become the block generation nodes in the next cycle, and the
nodes which are not the top 21 ones with the highest number of okt in
the set will be forced to quit. The number of okt should only be an
integer, and the decimal part is not considered when the comparison of
the numbers of nodes supported by the sets is made during rotation.

cli command
-----------

staking cli contains the following 5 commands for PoS operations,
providing complete support for equity circulation.

-  create-validator：create a validator

-  edit-validator：update a validator

-  delegate：delegate proof of stake

-  unbond：undelegate

-  redelegate：re-delegate

Create a validator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade a node to a validator through self-delegation and set the
description, commission rate and related change limits on a validator.

.. code:: bash

    okchaincli tx staking create-validator --amount=2okt --pubkey=$(okchaind tendermint show-validator) --moniker="my nickname" --identity="logo|||http://mywebsite/pic/logo.jpg" --website="http://mywebsite" --details="my slogan" --commission-rate="0.10" --commission-max-rate="0.50" --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" --min-self-delegation="1" --from jack

-  amount indicates the number of self-delegated okt
-  pubkey represents the tendermint public key of the current node
-  moniker indicates the alias of the validator
-  identity specifies the address of the validator’s profile picture
-  website indicates the validator’s website address
-  details indicate the validator’s detailed description
-  commission-rate indicates the current commission rate (rounded to at
   most 2 decimal places)
-  commission-max-rate indicates the maximum commission rate of the
   validator that cannot be set to exceed the maximum commission rate
   (rounded to at most 2 decimal places)
-  commission-max-change-rate indicates the maximum adjustment rate that
   is acceptable each time when the commission rate is adjusted.
   Adjustments exceeding such maximum adjustment rate become invalid
   (rounded to at most 2 decimal places)
-  min-self-delegation indicates the minimum number of self-delegated
   okt. If the number is lower than the minimum number of self-delegated
   okt, the self-delegation is invalid
-  from specifies the operator’s account, which is jack here

Update a validator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operator can update the description of the validator and adjust the
commission rate.

.. code:: bash

    okchaincli tx staking edit-validator --moniker=“my new nickname” --identity="logo|||http://mynewwebsite/pic/newlogo.jpg" --website="http://mynewwebsite" --details="my new slogan" --commission-rate="0.11" --from jack

-  moniker indicates the alias of the validator to be updated
-  identity specifies the address of the profile picture of the
   validator to be updated
-  website indicates the website address of the validator to be updated
-  details indicate the detailed description of the validator to be
   updated
-  commission-rate indicates the commission rate to be updated which can
   only be updated once every 24 hours, and the adjustment cannot exceed
   commission-max-change-rate
-  from specifies the operator’s account, which is jack here

Delegate proof of stake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

okchain users can delegate their proof of stake to several validators to
authorize them to perform related obligations on their behalf, such as
voting on proposals. By delegating proof of stake, users can receive
rewards and participate in okchain governance.

.. code:: bash

    okchaincli tx staking delegate okchainvaloper1005qzgwplwu8hf9pjhhtlm0t2x27hyppgqc2w6 20okt  --from rose
    * In the example, okchainvaloper1005qzgwplwu8hf9pjhhtlm0t2x27hyppgqc2w6 is the validator’s address, and 20okt is the number of okt to be delegated.

-  from indicates the delegate user’s account, which is rose here

Undelegate
~~~~~~~~~~

okchain users can cancel the delegation and redeem their delegated
shares for okt. Users must wait for 2 election periods to receive the
redeemed okt after undelegation.

.. code:: bash

    okchaincli tx staking unbond okchainvaloper1005qzgwplwu8hf9pjhhtlm0t2x27hyppgqc2w6 10 --from rose
    * In the example, okchainvaloper1005qzgwplwu8hf9pjhhtlm0t2x27hyppgqc2w6 is the validator’s address, and 10 is the number of the delegated share to be undelegated

-  from indicates the user account to be undelegated, which is rose here

Re-delegate
~~~~~~~~~~~

okchain users can re-delegate the delegated shares at validatora to
validatorb by re-delegating transactions. Re-delegated transactions
during the current cycle will be effective in the next cycle.

.. code:: bash

    okchaincli tx staking redelegate okchainvaloper1005qzgwplwu8hf9pjhhtlm0t2x27hyppgqc2w6 okchainvaloper1alq9na49n9yycysh889rl90g9nhe58lcs50wu5 10 --from rose
    * * In the example, okchainvaloper1005qzgwplwu8hf9pjhhtlm0t2x27hyppgqc2w6 is the validator_a’s address, and okchainvaloper1alq9na49n9yycysh889rl90g9nhe58lcs50wu5 is the validator_b’s address, and 10 is the number of the delegated share to be re-delegated

-  from indicates the user account to be re-delegated, which is rose
   here

To ensure PoS security, re-delegated transactions within each cycle will
be divided into three types for processing:

-  If the src validator of re-delegated transactions is the node that
   generates blocks in the next cycle, the transaction will be delayed
   until the next cycle. The earliest execution time is the first block
   height in the next cycle and the latest execution time is the
   penultimate block height in the next cycle. The re-delegated
   transactions in the same src validator will replace the delayed
   transactions and only the latest re-delegated transactions will be
   executed;

-  If the src validator of re-delegated transactions is the node that
   exits the block generation node set, the transaction will be delayed
   until the first block height is executed in the next cycle;

-  If the src validator of re-delegated transactions is not within the
   block generation node set in the next cycle and is not the node that
   exits the block generation node set, the transaction will be executed
   immediately.
