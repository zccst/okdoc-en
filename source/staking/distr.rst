2. Reward source
----------------

-  All transaction related fees (`fee <../%20fee.md>`__)
-  Other fees

   1. **Issuance fee：**\ amount of okt required to be paid by the
      project team to issue tokens
   2. **Listing fee：**\ amount of okt paid by the project team after
      listing
   3. **Deduction for proposal failure：**\ nodes need to deposit a
      certain amount of okt for a proposal. If the proposal fails, the
      amount of pledged okt is deducted
   4. **Business parameter change：**\ the project team modifies the
      relevant precision parameters of tokens issued

3. Distribution period
----------------------

Reward distribution is performed once every 259200 blocks. Rewards are
automatically deposited to corresponding accounts at the end of the
period.

4. Dividend strategy
--------------------

4.1 Distribution to the reward pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**After the execution of each block ends**, rewards are distributed to
each validator’s respective reward pool according to the weight of
validators participating in voting.

If the reward to be distributed in the current block is totalReward, the
reward obtained by each validator is:

.. code:: math

        validatorReward = (validatorPower / totalPower) * totalReward

Note:

1. The operation is performed at the end of each block

2. During the operation, all rewards in the block are distributed to
   reward pools of different validators, which will not be directly
   deposited to corresponding accounts

3. If small change is left during the distribution, it is transferred
   into the reward pool of the block’s proposer

**Example：** If there are three validators: V1, V2 and V3, the
votingPower is 100, 200 and 300 respectively, and the total reward in
the current block is 1000okt, If the distribution unit is 1okt, the
rewards received by reward pools of the three validators are as follows:

::

    validatorReward1 = (100 / 600) * 1000 = 166okt
    validatorReward2 = (200 / 600) * 1000 = 333okt
    validatorReward3 = (300 / 600) * 1000 = 500okt

The remaining change is: remaining = 1000 - 166 - 333 - 500 = 1okt. If
V1 is the proposer of the current block, the remaining 1okt will be
distributed to V1’s reward pool and the final reward of V1 will be 166 +
1 = 167okt.

4.2 Distribution to corresponding accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**At the end of each distribution period**, the funds in each
validator’s reward pool are distributed to corresponding accounts. Take
the distribution to the reward pool of a validator as an example:

1. First, calculate the commission for each validator at the
   corresponding rate and distribute the commission to the accounts of
   validators

2. The remaining rewards in the reward pool (remainReward) are
   distributed to the accounts of delegators according to the weight of
   each delegator

   .. code:: math

           delegatorReward = (delegatorShare / totalShare) * remainReward

Note:

1. The operation is performed at the end of each distribution period

2. If small change is left during the distribution, it is transferred
   into validators' accounts

**Example：** If a validator’s commission rate is 20%, there are three
delegators: D1, D2 and D3 with shares of 100, 200 and 300 respectively
and the validator’s reward pool has a total of 10,000okt; If the
dividend unit is 1okt, the validator and the three delegators can
receive the rewards as follows:

::

    validatorReward = 10000 * 20% = 2000okt
    delegatorReward1 = (100 / 600) * (10000 - 2000) = 1333okt
    validatorReward2 = (200 / 600) * (10000 - 2000) = 2666okt
    validatorReward3 = (300 / 600) * (10000 - 2000) = 4000okt

The remaining change is：remaining = 10000 - 2000 - 1333 - 2666 - 4000 =
1okt。 The remaining 1okt will be distributed to the address of the
validator, the final reward of the validator is 2000 + 1 = 2001okt.

5. Operation example
--------------------

Distribution module related functions
-------------------------------------

okchain adopts an active distribution approach. At the end of each
distribution period, rewards are distributed to users’ accounts. Please
refer to the design documentation for detailed reward distribution
strategies and resources ### Distribution related tx operation 1. Change
the distribution address (new rewards will be distributed to the newly
set address after change)

.. code:: sh

    # Set the withdraw address for rewards associated with a delegator address:
    $ okchaincli tx set-withdraw-addr okchain1gghjut3ccd8ay0zduzj64hwre2fxs9ld75ru9p --from [mykey]
    Usage:
      okchaincli tx distr set-withdraw-addr [withdraw-addr] [flags]

Distribution related query operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Query parameters of the distribution system

   .. code:: sh

       okchaincli query distr params --chain-id okchain

2. Query information on all rewards

   ::

       okchaincli query distr validator-outstanding-rewards [valAddress] --chain-id okchain

3. Query information on the validator’s commission

   .. code:: sh

       okchaincli query distr commission [valAddress]  --chain-id okchain

4. Query the rewards of the delegator. If okchainvaloper is not input,
   it means that you query the information on the rewards from all
   delegators

   .. code:: sh

       okchaincli query distr rewards [accAddress] [valAddress]  --chain-id okchain
