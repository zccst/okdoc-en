OKChain FAQ
===========

What is OKChain?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    OKChain is a commercial chain developed by OKEx based on cosmos sdk,
    which is the underlying framework that underpins the OKT ecosystem.
    While maintaining the cross-chain functions of Cosmos SDK, it aims
    to serve as a secure and efficient DeFi infrastructure and offer
    blockchain solutions optimized for different financial applications
    on the downstream blockchain ecosystem by drawing on OKEx’s
    extensive experience in the cryptocurrency sector.

What are the use cases of OKChain?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    As a system underpinning OKT, OKChain’s most basic function is
    payment. A stablecoin USDK will also be issued on OKChain’s mainnet.
    OKChain will also launch the first DeFi application, DEX. We are
    exploring to offer other DeFi applications, such as a cross-chain
    with BTC, decentralized lending products and new financial
    derivatives businesses.

What is a commercial chain? What is the difference between a public chain and a consortium chain?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Although public and consortium chains are commonly known as basic
    types of blockchains, there is no detailed and accepted taxonomy. In
    order to define commercial chain clearly, we elaborate the term from
    the perspectives of permission mechanism and target user:

    As for the permission mechanism, each node on the public chain can
    freely enter and exit the network as well as read and write on-chain
    data. All nodes are interconnected under a flat topology. There are
    no centralized server nodes on the network. The level of
    decentralization is high. Each node on the consortium chain usually
    relates to a corresponding entity, and all interested entities form
    the consortium and jointly maintain the healthy operation of the
    blockchain. It is often necessary to enter and exit the network
    after permission. A consortium chain may be able to ensure the
    responsible design of the permission mechanism for reading and
    writing on-chain data.

    For target users, the existing public chain, whether it is used for
    payment or global computing, is often aimed at solving the needs of
    end users. We can see that even if business-to-business users are
    using the public chain, they can enjoy the same user experience
    enjoyed by consumer users. It is totally different when it comes to
    consortium chains. It is obvious from the existing projects,
    especially consortium chain projects, that TOKEN is mainly designed
    to resolve the allocation of interests between entities. All
    clearing, settlement, traceability and loyalty point solutions are
    of enterprise-level.

    Libra is the project that gives the chance for us to consider the
    positioning of commercial chain.

    It is well known that, unlike the public chain that focuses on
    decentralization, Libra is designed by Facebook for profits. The
    reason why users are interested in Libra is that there are many
    large companies like Facebook which will launch their products on
    Libra, but not because it is a decentralized system.

    Therefore, we believe that the blockchain projects for consumer
    users guaranteed by the reputation of several companies are
    different from public and consortium chain projects. We call them
    commercial chains.

What is the strategic positioning of OKChain?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    OKEx has been thinking about its position in the cryptocurrency
    industry. We believe that we are a crypto credit enhancement service
    provider. The core value of OKChain is credit enhancement, which
    currently is most needed for the exchange of cryptocurrencies.
    Therefore, what OKChain offers is not certain technologies, but
    products and services. It is unnecessary to solve all matters in the
    most efficient way. We have well addressed those needs for high
    efficiency. However, in some cases, there are users who are more
    concerned about the issues of asset security and fairness, so that
    we have been working on developing our own decentralized exchange as
    a supplement, rather than a replacement, to our existing products in
    order to offer a more comprehensive credit enhancement service.

What is DEX and what are the advantages of DEX?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    DEX is the first DeFi application launched by and in sync with
    OKChain, which is a system that saves orderbook and order matching
    data. The most mature DeFi application is Ethereum’s DeFi project.
    However, it has some inherent limitations. First, it is not
    efficient enough and the block generation interval is too long.
    Second, it adopts gas transaction sequencing. In many financial
    scenarios, time difference results in information gaps. The
    inconsistencies caused by information gaps cannot be covered by gas,
    which brings unfairness to users. Attacks on some applications on
    Ethereum are also made based on the characteristics of gas
    sequencing. Third, it runs with the support of Ethereum’s smart
    contracts, which have design limitations that increase complexity
    but reduce security. Therefore, Ethereum is an excellent pioneer but
    not the best option. Compared with Ethereum products, we draw on
    years of experience in the cryptocurrency sector to offer better
    solutions for different scenarios on-chain, such as removing the
    design of gas sequencing and using a cross-chain solution instead.
    Multi-chain solutions can cover the shortcomings of a single chain,
    but they cannot be developed by one company alone. In fact, a
    multi-chain is an ecology. OKEx has always attached great importance
    to the development of DeFi by developing its own ecology starting
    from infrastructure building. Welcome to join OKEx. There are many
    other peers doing similar things now. In this new area, we are all
    explorers and will focus on the development of the entire industry.

What is a proposal? Why should I vote?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Currently there are 4 types of proposals available. In addition to
    text proposals merely for statistical needs such as "do you agree to
    add a leverage function", listing application, parameter change and
    version upgrade functions can be governed by our designated
    proposals. OKT users have the corresponding right to express their
    views. They also have the right to vote abstain, although we do not
    recommend that you do so.

What is the difference between NO and NowithVeto?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    According to our algorithm, if more than 1/3 of OKT users vote
    NowithVeto, the proposal will not be passed even if more than half
    vote Yes.

What are the restrictions on initiating proposals?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Different proposals have slightly different restrictions. Generally,
    they share one restriction that the amount of a deposit should at
    least correspond to the minimum deposit amount required by the
    proposal, and the applicant submitting the proposal must be able to
    make the deposit. For example, the minimum deposit amount for a
    listing application proposal is 20000 OKT, and the applicant must
    make a deposit of at least 20%, which is 4000 OKT. Also, there are
    restrictions on applicants. The applicants can only submit listing
    application and parameter change proposals by using the accounts for
    token listing. Parameter change and version upgrade proposals can
    only be submitted by the nodes in the validator set in the current
    cycle.

What is the relationship between OKChain, cosmos and Tendermint?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    OKChain develops its own dex business based on cosmos-sdk and
    continues to use Tendermint's network and consensus code, which lays
    the foundation for OKChain to connect to other cosmos-based chains
    in the future. However, due to special business needs of DEX, we
    revamp the governance and consensus election modules to support our
    business.

How many supernodes does OKChain have?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    21 super nodes in total

What is the consensus algorithm of OKChain? Can I mine?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    OKChain adopts a POS + BFT algorithm. We do not support mining, but
    OKT holders can earn corresponding yields by pledging OKT to the
    validator in our system.

How do validation nodes prevent DDos attacks?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    This is a complex issue that involves many details. On a macro
    scale, a number of factors, such as disaster recovery, personnel
    supervision, system firewall and VPN, are considered in designing
    validation nodes.
